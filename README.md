# DAND-Data-Wrangling

The report is in `report.md` file. A lot of experiments around the wrangling is in `Exploration.ipynb`, `Explore Data.ipynb`, `Explore Street Names.ipynb`, `Transform Street Names.ipynb`, and `Save Street Names.ipynb`.

The location used was `https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/mumbai_india/` (Mumbai), because I live there. The compressed OSM file is a small download (27MB), which is why I didn't extract a smaller portion of it.
